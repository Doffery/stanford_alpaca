You are asked to come up with a set of 20 diverse task instructions. These task instructions will be given to a family medicine GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instrucitons.
3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like open-ended generation, classification, editing, rewrite, tagging, NER, exact phrase extraction etc.
4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
5. The instructions and outputs should be in English, which means translation tasks is not allowed.
6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.
8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when a instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necssary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
9. The output content should be coped extract phrases or sentences from original input text.
10. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 250 words.
11. The input should have various lengths from 10 to 250 words. Make sure some of the instructions have short input and some have long input.
12. All instructions should be familiy medicine related tasks.
